<fields>

  <!-- Note: the main schema.xml file indicates that each doc must have a unique 'id' field.  We form that
       by concatenating document-type_primaryKey (for the great majority of docs that have primaryKey) -->

  <!-- Every document must be labeled with its type, drawn from an enum.
       In order for the site search service to expose a doc type to the client, the doc type must be included
       in the 'document-categories' meta document. See SiteSearchData/Model/data/documentTypeCategories.json -->
  
  <field name="document-type" type="documentType" required="true" indexed="true" stored="true"/>

  
  <!-- Every document is loaded as part of a batch (no exceptions).  These fields describe that batch.  For every batch
       loaded, there is a corresponding batch (meta) document containing the same information, and
       indicating that the batch was loaded successfully -->

  <!-- The site search service limits solr queries to searching only instances of these two dynamic fields.
       No other fields are ever searched by the service.
       We set storeOffsetsWithPositions and termVectors to true because the solr docs indicate doing so speeds up highlighting.
       In order for the site search service to know about any fields, they must be included in the 'document-fields'
       meta document. See SiteSearchData/Model/data/nonWdkDocumentFields.json (WDK field info is generated automatically by the
       loaders) -->

  <!-- An additional optional field indicating the project this document is associated with.  This is provided for applications other than
       the Site Search Service (such as the Apollo Comment Updater) that need to know which project documents belong to, including
